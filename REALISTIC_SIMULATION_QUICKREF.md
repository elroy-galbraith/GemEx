# 🚀 Realistic Simulation - Quick Reference

## ✅ Integration Complete!

Your system now uses **real historical price data** instead of hash-based simulation.

---

## 📊 What Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Hash-based outcomes | ✅ Real Yahoo Finance price data |
| Generic timestamps | ✅ Actual entry/exit times |
| Predetermined results | ✅ Validates which hit first: SL or TP |
| Same date = same outcome | ✅ Based on actual price movement |

---

## 🎯 How to Use

### Daily Run (Production)
```bash
source gemx_venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=$PWD python ace_main.py --cycle daily
```

### Test Historical Trade
```bash
python tests/test_realistic_simulation.py
```

### Backtest Strategy
```python
from gemex.ace.realistic_simulation import backtest_trading_plan

results = backtest_trading_plan(
    trading_plan={...},
    start_date="2025-10-01",
    end_date="2025-10-31"
)
```

## 🔍 Check if It's Working

Look for this in your trade log:

```json
{
  "execution": {
    "method": "real_price_data"  ← This confirms real data was used!
  }
}
```

If you see `"method": "hash_based_fallback"`, it means real data wasn't available (weekend/holiday/error) and the system fell back to simple simulation.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Q: Seeing "hash_based_fallback"?**
A: Normal for weekends, holidays, or when data isn't available yet.

**Q: Want more precise data?**
A: Edit `realistic_simulation.py` line ~55, change `interval="15m"` to `"5m"` or `"1m"`

**Q: Different results than before?**
A: Expected! Real data ≠ hash predictions. This is more accurate.
