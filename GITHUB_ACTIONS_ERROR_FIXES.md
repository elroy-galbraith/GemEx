# GitHub Actions Error Fixes

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Python Indentation Error in Workflow ✅

**Error**:
```
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

**Location**: `.github/workflows/ace-trading.yml` - Display playbook summary step

**Cause**: Multi-line Python code in YAML doesn't preserve indentation correctly when using the heredoc syntax.

**Fix**: Converted multi-line Python to single-line command:

**Before**:
```yaml
python -c "
  import json
  with open('data/playbook.json') as f:
      p = json.load(f)
  print(f\"Version: {p['metadata']['version']}\")
  ..."
```

**After**:
```yaml
python -c "import json; p = json.load(open('data/playbook.json')); print(f\"Version: {p['metadata']['version']}\"); ..."
```

### Issue 2: Gemini API Safety Filter Blocking Response ✅

**Error**:
```
❌ Error generating plan: Invalid operation: The `response.text` quick accessor 
requires the response to contain a valid `Part`, but none were returned. 
The candidate's [finish_reason](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#finishreason) is 2.
```

**Location**: `gemex/ace/components.py` - `run_generator()` function

**Cause**: 
- `finish_reason=2` means `SAFETY` - response was blocked by Gemini's safety filters
- The code was trying to access `response.text` when no parts were returned
- This can happen when the AI detects potentially problematic content in the prompt

**Fix Applied** (2 layers):

#### Layer 1: Better Error Handling in `run_generator()`
Added explicit check for blocked responses before accessing `response.text`:

```python
# Check for blocked response
if not response.parts:
    finish_reason = getattr(response.candidates[0], 'finish_reason', None)
    safety_ratings = getattr(response.candidates[0], 'safety_ratings', [])
    
    error_msg = f"Response blocked (finish_reason={finish_reason})"
    if safety_ratings:
        blocked_categories = [r.category for r in safety_ratings if r.blocked]
        if blocked_categories:
            error_msg += f" - Blocked categories: {blocked_categories}"
    
    print(f"⚠️  {error_msg}")
    print("⚠️  This is likely due to Gemini's safety filters. Using neutral plan.")
    
    return {
        "date": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        "bias": "neutral",
        "rationale": "Response blocked by safety filters",
        "confidence": "low",
        "playbook_bullets_used": [],
        "error": error_msg
    }

# Now safe to access response.text
plan_text = response.text.strip()
```

#### Layer 2: Graceful Degradation in `ace_daily_cycle()`
Added try-except wrapper around the generator call:

```python
try:
    trading_plan = run_generator(playbook, market_data)
    save_trading_plan(trading_plan)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Error generating plan: {e}")
    print("⚠️  This may be due to:")
    print("   - Gemini API safety filters blocking the response")
    print("   - Network issues or API rate limits")
    print("   - Invalid market data format")
    print("   Skipping to next steps with empty plan...")
    trading_plan = {
        "date": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        "bias": "neutral",
        "confidence": "low",
        "reasoning": "Plan generation failed - see logs for details",
        "error": str(e)
    }
    save_trading_plan(trading_plan)
```

## Why Gemini Safety Filters May Block

The safety filters can trigger on:
1. **Financial advice** - Trading strategies might be flagged
2. **Market predictions** - Forecasting price movements
3. **Risk-related content** - Stop losses, position sizing
4. **Sensitive topics** - Economic events, political news

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. The System Now Handles It Gracefully ✅
- Returns a neutral plan instead of crashing
- Logs detailed error information
- Continues with the rest of the daily cycle

### 2. If This Happens Frequently
You can adjust the prompts to be less direct:
- Use "analysis" instead of "prediction"
- Frame as "educational simulation" 
- Avoid strong directional language
- Use conditional phrasing ("if X then Y")

### 3. Alternative: Use Different Model
If safety filters are too aggressive, consider:
- `gemini-1.5-flash` (less strict)
- Adjust temperature (currently 0.7)
- Use different prompt engineering

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/ace-trading.yml`**
   - Fixed Python indentation in playbook summary step
   
2. **`gemex/ace/components.py`**
   - Added safety filter check in `run_generator()`
   - Returns neutral plan when blocked
   - Provides detailed error information

3. **`gemex/ace/main.py`**
   - Added try-except around generator call
   - Graceful degradation with fallback plan
   - Informative error messages

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test the ACE daily cycle
python gemex/ace/main.py --cycle daily
```

If you see:
```
⚠️  Response blocked (finish_reason=2)
⚠️  This is likely due to Gemini's safety filters. Using neutral plan.
```

The system is working correctly - it's handling the safety block gracefully.

### GitHub Actions Testing
The workflow will now:
1. Not crash when safety filters trigger
2. Log informative error messages
3. Continue with a neutral trading plan
4. Complete the daily cycle successfully

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fixes:
```
❌ Error generating plan: Invalid operation...
[Workflow crashes]
```

### After Fixes:
```
⚠️  Response blocked by safety filters. Using neutral plan.
✅ Plan saved (neutral bias)
✅ Telegram notification sent
✅ Trade simulation completed
✅ Playbook updated
✅ Daily cycle complete
```

## Monitoring

After deploying these fixes, monitor:
1. **Frequency of safety blocks** - If it happens often, adjust prompts
2. **Error logs** - Check which categories are being blocked
3. **Neutral plans** - Count how many days result in neutral bias
4. **Alternative solutions** - Consider prompt engineering or model changes

## Summary

✅ **Both issues fixed**:
- YAML Python indentation → Single-line command
- Gemini safety filter → Graceful error handling

✅ **System now resilient**:
- Won't crash on API errors
- Provides informative logging
- Continues daily cycle even with failures
- Returns neutral plans when generation fails

✅ **Ready for production**:
- Deploy and monitor
- Adjust prompts if needed
- Consider model alternatives if blocks are frequent
