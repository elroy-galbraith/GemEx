# Using GemEx in Simulation Mode - Quick Start Guide

## Overview

**Good news:** Your GemEx ACE system is **fully functional in simulation mode** right now! You can run it for a week (or longer) to:

1. ‚úÖ See how the AI analyzes real market data
2. ‚úÖ Watch the playbook evolve over time
3. ‚úÖ Track simulated trading performance
4. ‚úÖ Build confidence in the system
5. ‚úÖ Identify areas for improvement

**No broker connection needed!** The system will simulate trade execution based on the trading plans.

---

## How Simulation Mode Works

### What's Real:
- ‚úÖ **Market data** - Actual EURUSD prices from Yahoo Finance
- ‚úÖ **Technical analysis** - Real chart patterns and indicators
- ‚úÖ **Economic calendar** - Live news events from Forex Factory
- ‚úÖ **AI analysis** - Gemini generates trading plans based on real conditions
- ‚úÖ **Playbook evolution** - System learns from simulated outcomes

### What's Simulated:
- üé≤ **Trade execution** - System simulates whether trades would win/lose
- üé≤ **P&L calculation** - Based on the trading plan's risk/reward
- üé≤ **Entry/exit timing** - Assumes trades enter at midpoint of entry zone

### Simulation Logic:

The simulation is currently **simple but functional**:

```python
# Based on plan confidence:
if confidence == "high":
    win_probability = 66% (2 out of 3 trades win)
elif confidence == "medium":
    win_probability = 50% (1 out of 2 trades win)
else:  # low confidence
    win_probability = 0% (trades lose)
```

**Why this works for testing:**
- Tests the full system workflow
- Validates playbook evolution logic
- Shows you the quality of AI-generated plans
- Gives realistic feedback loop

**Limitations:**
- Not based on actual price movement
- Doesn't account for slippage or spread
- Win/loss is deterministic (based on date hash)
- Doesn't validate entry zone quality

## Your Week-Long Test Plan

### Day 1 (Today): Setup & First Run

```bash
# 1. Activate environment
source gemx_venv/bin/activate

# 2. Generate today's trading plan
python ace_main.py --cycle daily

# 3. Review what was generated
cat trading_session/$(date +%Y_%m_%d)/trading_plan.md
cat trading_session/$(date +%Y_%m_%d)/trade_log.json
```

**What to observe:**
- Does the trading plan make sense?
- Is the bias (bullish/bearish/neutral) logical?
- Are entry zones and stop losses reasonable?
- Did the simulation execute a trade?

---

### Days 2-5: Daily Routine

**Every morning (before market open):**

```bash
source gemx_venv/bin/activate
python ace_main.py --cycle daily
```

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] Trading plan generated successfully
- [ ] Charts created (15M, 1H, 4H timeframes)
- [ ] Trade log shows execution outcome
- [ ] Playbook usage timestamps updated

**Keep a simple log:**
```
Day 1: Bias=neutral, No trade
Day 2: Bias=bullish, Entry=1.0850, Win, +30 pips
Day 3: Bias=bearish, Entry=1.0820, Loss, -20 pips
...
```

---

### Day 5 (Friday): Weekly Reflection

```bash
# Run weekly cycle
python ace_main.py --cycle weekly
```

**This will:**
1. Load all 5 days of trade logs
2. Analyze performance patterns
3. Generate insights about what worked/didn't work
4. Update the playbook with new bullets
5. Increment playbook version

**Review the reflection:**
```bash
# View reflection
cat weekly_reflections/$(ls -t weekly_reflections/ | head -1) | jq '.'

# Check playbook changes
cat data/playbook.json | jq '.metadata'

# See what bullets were added
cat data/playbook.json | jq '.sections.strategies_and_hard_rules[-3:]'
```

---

## What to Track During the Week

### Daily Metrics:

Create a simple spreadsheet or text file:

```
Date       | Bias    | Entry   | SL      | TP1     | Outcome | Pips | Notes

## End of Week Analysis

After running for 5 trading days, analyze:

### System Performance:

```bash
# Count trades
echo "Total sessions:" $(find trading_session -type d -name "2025_*" | wc -l)

# Count trade logs
echo "Trade logs created:" $(find trading_session -name "trade_log.json" | wc -l)

# View playbook evolution
echo "Playbook version:" $(cat data/playbook.json | jq -r '.metadata.version')
echo "Total bullets:" $(cat data/playbook.json | jq -r '.metadata.total_bullets')
```

### Questions to Answer:

1. **Did the system run reliably?**
   - Were trading plans generated every day?
   - Were there any errors or crashes?
   - Did charts generate correctly?

2. **Were the trading plans actionable?**
   - Did they have specific entry zones?
   - Were stop losses and targets clear?
   - Would you have taken these trades manually?

3. **Did the playbook improve?**
   - Compare v1.0 to current version
   - Are new bullets relevant?
   - Do they reflect the week's outcomes?

4. **What's the simulated performance?**
   - Simulated win rate
   - Simulated average pips
   - Pattern: high confidence ‚Üí better outcomes?

---

## Comparing Simulation vs. Reality

**Optional: Manual validation during the week**

If you want to see how simulation compares to reality:

1. **Each day, check if the trade would have actually won:**
   - Use TradingView to review EURUSD price action
   - Did price reach the entry zone?
   - Would stop loss have been hit?
   - Would take profit have been reached?

2. **Track two columns:**
   ```
   Date | Simulated Outcome | Actual Outcome | Match?
   -----|-------------------|----------------|-------
   Mon  | Win (+30 pips)    | Win (+25 pips) | ‚úÖ
   Tue  | Loss (-20 pips)   | No entry       | ‚ùå
   Wed  | Win (+40 pips)    | Win (+45 pips) | ‚úÖ
   ```

3. **This tells you:**
   - How accurate is the simulation?
   - Are entry zones realistic?
   - Do trades actually trigger?

---

## After the Week: Next Steps

### If Results Look Good (50%+ simulated win rate):

‚úÖ **Continue for another 2-3 weeks** to build confidence

‚úÖ **Start manual paper trading** alongside simulation
   - Execute trades manually in OANDA demo
   - Compare manual vs. simulated results
   - See which is more accurate

‚úÖ **Consider building broker integration**
   - After 30+ days of good results
   - See PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md for roadmap

### If Results Are Mixed (40-50% simulated win rate):

‚ö†Ô∏è **Continue simulation but observe:**
   - What causes losses?
   - Are losses on low-confidence trades?
   - Is playbook evolving in right direction?
   - Do you agree with AI's bias calls?

‚ö†Ô∏è **Consider improvements:**
   - Better entry zone logic
   - More conservative confidence rating
   - Enhanced intermarket analysis
   - Additional filters (volatility, time of day)

### If Results Are Poor (<40% simulated win rate):

‚ùå **Don't trade real money yet!**

üîç **Debug the system:**
   - Check if market data is accurate
   - Review AI prompts (prompts.py)
   - Analyze playbook bullets
   - Look for systematic bias errors

üõ†Ô∏è **Potential fixes:**
   - Improve Generator prompts
   - Add more conservative filters
   - Enhance risk management logic
   - Better confidence assessment

## Simulation Mode Limitations

Be aware that simulation is **not perfect**:

‚ùå **Oversimplified outcomes** - Real trading is messier
‚ùå **No slippage/spread** - Actual costs not included
‚ùå **Deterministic results** - Same plan ‚Üí same outcome
‚ùå **Entry assumption** - May not reflect reality
‚ùå **No market impact** - Assumes perfect fills

**But that's OK!** The goal this week is to:
- Validate the system runs smoothly
- Check AI analysis quality
- Watch playbook evolution
- Build your workflow

You'll validate actual execution later with manual paper trading or broker integration.

## Sample Week Schedule

### Monday:
```bash
8:00 AM - Run: python ace_main.py --cycle daily
8:05 AM - Review trading plan
8:10 AM - Note: Would I take this trade?
5:00 PM - Check trade_log.json outcome
5:05 PM - Log results in tracking sheet
```

### Tuesday-Thursday:
```bash
Repeat Monday's routine
```

### Friday:
```bash
8:00 AM - Run: python ace_main.py --cycle daily
5:00 PM - Run: python ace_main.py --cycle weekly
5:10 PM - Review weekly reflection
5:20 PM - Check playbook updates
5:30 PM - Analyze week's performance
6:00 PM - Plan for next week
```

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

### "No trading plan generated"
```bash
# Check for errors
python ace_main.py --cycle daily 2>&1 | tee error.log
cat error.log
```

### "Always neutral bias"
- This can be normal! System is being conservative
- Check market conditions - is there a clear trend?
- Review intermarket data - are there conflicts?
- If 5 days = 5 neutral, may need to adjust prompts

### "Same outcome every day"
- This is expected with current simulation
- Outcomes are deterministic based on date
- For more realistic simulation, we'd need to enhance the logic
- Not a problem for testing workflow

### "Playbook not updating"
- Check if weekly reflection ran successfully
- Verify insights were generated
- Look for errors in Curator component
- May need at least 1 non-neutral trade for meaningful reflection
