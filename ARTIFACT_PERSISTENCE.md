# ACE System - GitHub Actions Artifact Persistence

## Overview

The ACE trading system now has **full artifact persistence** in GitHub Actions. This means:

✅ **Playbook evolution is preserved** across runs
✅ **Trading history accumulates** over time  
✅ **Weekly reflections persist** for long-term analysis
✅ **System state is continuous** (not reset daily)

## How It Works

### 1. Artifact Upload (After Each Run)

After every daily or weekly cycle, GitHub Actions uploads:

```
ace-session-{run_number}-{cycle}/
├── trading_session/          ← All daily trading plans and logs
│   ├── 2025_10_27/
│   ├── 2025_10_28/
│   └── ...
├── data/
│   ├── playbook.json         ← Current playbook state
│   └── playbook_history/     ← Version backups
│       ├── playbook_v1.0.json
│       ├── playbook_v1.1.json
│       └── ...
├── weekly_reflections/       ← All weekly analyses
│   ├── 2025_W44_reflection.json
│   └── ...
└── artifact_summary.json     ← Metadata about current state
```

**Retention:** 90 days (configurable in workflow)

---

### 2. Artifact Download (Before Each Run)

Before running the ACE cycle, GitHub Actions:

1. **Searches** for the most recent `ace-session-*` artifact
2. **Downloads** the entire artifact zip
3. **Extracts** all files to the workspace
4. **Validates** playbook, sessions, and reflections
5. **Reports** what was restored

This happens automatically via `ace_persistence.py`.

---

### 3. Continuous Evolution

**Day 1 (Monday):**
```
1. Download: No previous artifacts (fresh start)
2. Initialize: Create playbook v1.0 (5 default bullets)
3. Run: Daily cycle generates plan, simulates trade
4. Upload: Save playbook v1.0 + session data
```

**Day 2 (Tuesday):**
```
1. Download: Restore playbook v1.0 from Day 1
2. Load: Playbook has 5 bullets with usage data
3. Run: Daily cycle updates bullet timestamps
4. Upload: Save updated playbook + new session
```

**Day 5 (Friday):**
```
1. Download: Restore playbook + 4 days of sessions
2. Run Daily: Generate Friday's plan
3. Run Weekly: Analyze 5 days, update playbook
4. Playbook: Now v1.1 with 7 bullets (added 2)
5. Upload: Save evolved playbook + reflections
```

**Week 2 (Monday):**
```
1. Download: Restore playbook v1.1 (7 bullets)
2. Continue: System has "memory" from Week 1
3. Evolution: Playbook continues to grow
```

## Key Features

### Automatic State Recovery

The `ace_persistence.py` module handles:

- **GitHub API authentication** (uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- **Artifact discovery** (finds latest `ace-session-*`)
- **Download and extraction** (restores all files)
- **Validation** (ensures playbook structure is correct)
- **Graceful fallback** (starts fresh if no artifacts found)

### Artifact Summary

Each run creates `artifact_summary.json`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T17:30:00Z",
  "playbook": {
    "version": "1.2",
    "total_bullets": 8,
    "last_updated": "2025-10-27"
  },
  "trading_sessions": [
    "2025_10_21",
    "2025_10_22",
    ...
  ],
  "weekly_reflections": [
    "2025_W43_reflection.json",
    "2025_W44_reflection.json"
  ]
}
```

This gives you a quick snapshot of system state.

  2. Run `ace_main.py --cycle daily`
  3. Upload updated artifacts

### Weekly Cycle
- **Schedule:** Friday at 10:00 PM UTC (5:00 PM EST)
- **Trigger:** `cron: '0 22 * * 5'`
- **Actions:**
  1. Restore previous state
  2. Run `ace_main.py --cycle daily` (Friday's plan)
  3. Run `ace_main.py --cycle weekly` (reflection)
  4. Upload evolved playbook + reflection

### Manual Trigger
- **Available:** Yes (workflow_dispatch)

## What Gets Preserved

### ✅ Playbook Evolution
```python
# Week 1: v1.0 → v1.1 (added 2 bullets)
# Week 2: v1.1 → v1.2 (added 1, removed 1)
# Week 3: v1.2 → v1.3 (added 3 bullets)
# ... continues indefinitely
```

**All versions backed up** in `data/playbook_history/`

### ✅ Trading History
```
trading_session/
├── 2025_10_21/  ← Preserved
├── 2025_10_22/  ← Preserved
├── 2025_10_23/  ← Preserved
...
└── 2025_11_30/  ← 90 days of history
```

**Benefits:**
- Long-term performance tracking
- Pattern analysis across months
- Historical backtesting data

### ✅ Weekly Reflections
```
weekly_reflections/
├── 2025_W43_reflection.json  ← Preserved
├── 2025_W44_reflection.json  ← Preserved
├── 2025_W45_reflection.json  ← Preserved
...
```

**Benefits:**
- See how insights evolved
- Track playbook improvement
- Understand learning trajectory

## Configuration

### Workflow Settings

**In `.github/workflows/ace-trading.yml`:**

```yaml
# Artifact retention (default: 90 days)
retention-days: 90

# Artifact name pattern
name: ace-session-${{ github.run_number }}-${{ steps.cycle.outputs.cycle }}

# What to upload
path: |
  trading_session/
  data/playbook.json
  data/playbook_history/
  weekly_reflections/
  artifact_summary.json
```

**To change retention:**
- Edit `retention-days` value (max: 90 days for free tier)
- Higher retention = longer historical data
- Consider cost implications for private repos

---

## Required Secrets

Ensure these are set in your GitHub repository:

### Required
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - For AI-powered analysis

### Optional
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - For notifications
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` - For notifications

**Note:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub Actions.

---

## Monitoring & Validation

### Check Artifact Persistence

**View uploaded artifacts:**
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Click on a workflow run
3. Scroll to "Artifacts" section
4. Download `ace-session-*` to inspect

**Check restoration logs:**
```
🔄 Restoring previous ACE state...
✅ Found latest artifact: ace-session-123-daily (created 2025-10-27)
📥 Downloading artifact: ace-session-123-daily...
📦 Extracting artifact...
✅ Artifact extracted to .
📂 Restoring ACE components...
✅ Playbook restored: v1.1, 7 bullets
✅ 4 trading session(s) restored
   - 2025_10_27
   - 2025_10_26
   - 2025_10_25
✅ 1 weekly reflection(s) restored
   - 2025_W44_reflection.json
```

### Verify Playbook Evolution

**Check playbook version in logs:**
```
📚 Current Playbook Status:
Version: 1.2
Total Bullets: 8
Last Updated: 2025-10-27
```

**Should increment weekly:**
- Week 1: v1.0
- Week 2: v1.1
- Week 3: v1.2
- etc.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No previous artifacts found"

**First run ever?**
- This is normal!
- System will initialize fresh playbook
- Future runs will have artifacts

**Artifacts expired?**
- Default retention is 90 days
- After 90 days, oldest artifacts are deleted
- System will continue with most recent available

**Wrong artifact name?**
- Check `artifact_name_prefix` in code
- Default is `"ace-session"`
- Ensure workflow uploads with matching name

### "Failed to download artifact"

**Permissions issue?**
- Check `GITHUB_TOKEN` is available
- Verify workflow has `actions: read` permission
- Ensure repository is accessible

**API rate limit?**
- GitHub has API rate limits
- Usually not an issue for standard usage
- Check GitHub Actions logs for details

### "Invalid playbook structure"

**Corrupted artifact?**
- System will skip invalid playbook
- Initialize fresh playbook
- Check previous run for errors

**Version mismatch?**
- If playbook structure changed
- May need migration script
- Or start fresh with new structure

---

## Migration from Old System

If you were using the old `market_planner.py` workflow:

### What's Different

**Old system:**
- No playbook persistence
- No trade history accumulation
- Each run was independent
- Used `trading-session-*` artifacts

**New system:**
- Playbook evolves continuously
- Trade history accumulates
- Weekly reflections persist
- Uses `ace-session-*` artifacts

### Migration Steps

1. **Old artifacts are separate** - won't interfere
2. **New workflow starts fresh** - clean slate
3. **Playbook initializes automatically** - no action needed
4. **After first run** - artifacts begin accumulating

**No manual migration needed!**

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Don't Delete Recent Artifacts

Keep at least the **last 5 artifacts**:
- Allows system recovery
- Provides rollback option
- Enables debugging

### 2. Monitor Playbook Growth

**Healthy growth:**
- ~1-3 new bullets per week
- Occasional pruning of harmful bullets
- Version increments steadily

**Unhealthy growth:**
- No new bullets for weeks
- Version stuck at 1.0
- Bullets don't reflect actual trading

### 3. Review Weekly Reflections

**Check periodically:**
- Are insights meaningful?
- Do they match reality?
- Is playbook improving?

### 4. Backup Critical Artifacts

**Download key milestones:**
- After profitable weeks
- Before major system changes
- Every month for long-term archive

---

## Performance Impact

### Storage
- **Per daily run:** ~2-5 MB (charts + JSON)
- **Per week:** ~10-20 MB (5 days + reflection)
- **90 days:** ~100-200 MB total
- **GitHub limit:** 500 MB per artifact (plenty of room)

### Run Time
- **Artifact download:** ~5-10 seconds
- **Artifact upload:** ~5-10 seconds
- **Total overhead:** <30 seconds per run

**Minimal impact on overall workflow!**

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Cloud storage backup** - S3, GCS, or similar
2. **Database integration** - PostgreSQL for analytics
3. **Performance dashboards** - Web UI for visualization
4. **Artifact compression** - Reduce storage size
5. **Selective restoration** - Only download what's needed

### Long-term Data

After 90 days, consider:
- External backup solution
- Database migration
- Long-term analytics storage
- Historical performance tracking

---

## Summary

✅ **Fully automated** - No manual intervention needed
✅ **Continuous state** - Playbook and history persist
✅ **Graceful recovery** - Handles missing artifacts
