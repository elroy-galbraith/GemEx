### üíº Execute Trade (If bias is NOT neutral)

**In your OANDA practice account:**

1. **Set up limit order:**
   - Price: Midpoint of entry zone
   - Units: Based on 1% risk
   - Example: If entry zone is 1.0850-1.0860, set limit at 1.0855

2. **Add stop loss:**
   - Price: Exactly as system recommends
   - Never move stop loss closer to market

3. **Add take profit:**
   - TP1: First target (usually closer)
   - Optional TP2: Second target (further out)

4. **Record in trading journal:**
   - Copy plan details
   - Note your entry price
   - Note entry time

### üìä During NY Session (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST)

**Monitor, don't interfere:**

**If neutral bias:**

### "No module named 'pandas'"
```bash
source gemx_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "GEMINI_API_KEY not found"
```bash
# Check if .env exists
cat .env | grep GEMINI_API_KEY

# If missing, copy template and edit
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add your API key
```

### "No trading plan generated"
```bash
# Check for errors in the output
python ace_main.py --cycle daily 2>&1 | tee debug.log

# Verify market data
python -c "import yfinance as yf; print(yf.download('EURUSD=X', period='1d'))"
```

### "Trading plan is always neutral"
- This is normal! System is being conservative
- Check intermarket conditions
- Review economic calendar
- System may be waiting for better setup
