## Troubleshooting

### UI Won't Start

**Problem:** `streamlit: command not found`

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install streamlit
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API Key Warnings

**Problem:** "Gemini API Not Configured" in sidebar

**Solution:**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
# Or add to .env file
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env
```

### No Data Displayed

**Problem:** "No trading plan available"

**Solution:** Run the Daily Cycle at least once to generate data

### Command Timeout

**Problem:** Daily/Weekly cycle times out

**Solution:** The timeout is set to 5 minutes. If operations consistently take longer, you may need to:
- Check internet connection
- Verify API rate limits
- Run commands manually to debug

## Performance Tips

### Faster Loading

1. **Cache Data**: Streamlit automatically caches loaded data
2. **Limit History**: The UI only loads the 5 most recent sessions by default
3. **Lazy Loading**: Charts and data are loaded only when viewed

### Memory Management

- Large chart files are streamed, not loaded into memory
- JSON files are read on-demand
- Browser caching helps with repeated views

## Security Considerations

### Local Use Only (Default)

By default, the UI only accepts connections from `localhost`. This is safe for personal use.

### Remote Access

If you enable remote access:
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This allows anyone on your network to access the UI. Consider:
- Running behind a firewall
- Using authentication (Streamlit Cloud has built-in auth)
- Limiting to VPN access only

### API Key Security

- Never commit API keys to git
- Use `.env` files (already in `.gitignore`)
- Rotate keys regularly
- Monitor API usage for anomalies

## Customization

### Changing Theme

Create `.streamlit/config.toml`:

```toml
[theme]
primaryColor = "#1f77b4"
backgroundColor = "#ffffff"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#f0f2f6"
textColor = "#262730"
font = "sans serif"
```

### Modifying Layout

Edit `app.py`:
- Adjust column widths in `st.columns()`
- Change metric positions
- Add new pages to navigation
- Customize CSS in the `st.markdown()` blocks

### Adding Features

The UI is built modularly. To add a new page:

```python
elif page == "My New Page":
    st.markdown('<p class="main-header">üìä My New Page</p>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
    # Your custom code here
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Command Line + UI Hybrid

You can use both:

```bash
# Run daily cycle from terminal
python ace_main.py --cycle daily

# Then view results in UI
streamlit run app.py
```

### Automated + Manual

- Let GitHub Actions run scheduled cycles
- Use UI for manual analysis and review
- Best of both worlds

### Telegram + UI

- Telegram for mobile notifications
- UI for detailed desktop analysis
- Both work independently

## Support and Documentation

- [README.md](README.md) - Full system overview
- [ACE_README.md](ACE_README.md) - ACE system details
- [PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md](PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md) - Production deployment
