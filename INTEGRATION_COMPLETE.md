## 📊 How It Works Now

### Old Workflow (Hash-Based):
```
Trading Plan → Hash-Based Simulation → Generic Outcome → Trade Log
                     ↓
              (Same date = same result)
```

### **New Workflow (Price-Based):** ✅
```
Trading Plan → Fetch Real Price Data → Check Entry/SL/TP → Realistic Outcome → Trade Log
                     ↓                        ↓                    ↓
              (Yahoo Finance 15m)    (Actual price levels)  (Real timestamps)
```

## 🔍 Verification

### Test Run Completed: ✅

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Command:** `python ace_main.py --cycle daily`
**Result:** SUCCESS

**Output:**
```
[6/7] Simulating Trade Execution...
✅ Trade log saved to: trading_session/2025_10_30/trade_log.json
```

**Trade Log:**
- System correctly identified neutral bias
- No trade executed (as expected for neutral bias)
- Realistic simulation function was called

### Historical Test Verified: ✅

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Test:** `python tests/test_realistic_simulation.py`
**Result:** 
- Entry triggered at actual price level (1.16450)
- Stop loss hit at real price (1.16580)
- Loss confirmed with actual timing
- Method: `real_price_data` ✓

## 🚀 Usage

### Daily Workflow (Production):

```bash
cd /Users/elroygalbraith/Documents/Repos/GemEx
source gemx_venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=/Users/elroygalbraith/Documents/Repos/GemEx python ace_main.py --cycle daily
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ Fetches real market data from Yahoo Finance
2. ✅ AI generates trading plan based on actual conditions
3. ✅ **Realistic simulation validates plan with real price data**
4. ✅ Trade log shows actual entry/exit times and prices
5. ✅ Results sent to Telegram

### Test Specific Date:

```bash
# Test the realistic simulation on any historical date
python tests/test_realistic_simulation.py
```

### Backtest Strategy:

```python
from gemex.ace.realistic_simulation import backtest_trading_plan

results = backtest_trading_plan(
    trading_plan={
        "bias": "bearish_pattern",
        "entry_zone": [1.1644, 1.1645],
        "stop_loss": 1.1658,
        "take_profit_1": 1.1633
    },
    start_date="2025-10-01",
    end_date="2025-10-31"
)

# Analyze win rate
wins = sum(1 for r in results if r["execution"] and r["execution"].get("outcome") == "win")
print(f"Win Rate: {wins / len(results) * 100:.1f}%")
```

## 📋 Trade Log Format

### Enhanced Format (Real Data):

```json
{
  "plan_id": "2025-10-29",
  "execution": {
    "entry_time": "2025-10-29T13:15:00+00:00",  // ← Actual time price hit entry
    "entry_price": 1.16450,                      // ← Real fill price
    "exit_time": "2025-10-29T15:30:00+00:00",   // ← Actual time SL/TP hit
    "exit_price": 1.16580,                       // ← Real exit price
    "pnl_pips": -12,                             // ← Actual P&L
    "pnl_usd": -120,
    "outcome": "loss",
    "method": "real_price_data"                  // ← Confirms real data used
  },
  "feedback": {
    "entry_quality": "good",
    "exit_timing": "stopped_out",
    "unexpected_events": [],
    "playbook_bullets_feedback": {}
  }
}
```

### Fallback Format (When Real Data Unavailable):

```json
{
  "execution": {
    "method": "hash_based_fallback"              // ← Shows fallback was used
  },
  "feedback": {
    "unexpected_events": [
      "No price data available for this date"    // ← Reason for fallback
    ]
  }
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Adjust Simulation Parameters:

Edit `gemex/ace/realistic_simulation.py`:

```python
# Line 15-16: Adjust trading session duration
lookback_hours: int = 8  # Default: 8 hours for NY session
                         # Change to 12 for full day
                         # Change to 4 for short session
```

### Data Interval:

Currently using **15-minute candles** from Yahoo Finance (free tier).

**To upgrade to more precise data:**
- Change `interval="15m"` to `interval="5m"` (5-minute candles)
- Change `interval="1m"` to `interval="1m"` (1-minute candles - if available)

---

## 🔄 Fallback Behavior

The system **gracefully handles** situations where real data isn't available:

### Automatic Fallback Triggers:

1. **Weekend/Holiday** - No market data available
2. **Yahoo Finance Outage** - API not responding
3. **Data Not Yet Available** - Today's data not finalized
4. **Network Errors** - Connection issues

### Fallback Process:

```python
try:
    # Attempt realistic simulation with real data
    result = simulate_trade_with_real_data(plan)
except Exception:
    # Automatically fall back to hash-based simulation
    result = _fallback_simulation(plan, "reason")
```

You'll always get a result - either real or fallback is clearly marked in the log.

## 📊 Comparison: Oct 29 Results

### Hash-Based (Old):
```
Entry: 14:00 UTC (generic)
Exit:  16:30 UTC (generic)
P&L:   -13 pips
Method: Predetermined by hash
```

### **Price-Based (New):** ✅
```
Entry: 13:15 UTC (price actually touched zone)
Exit:  15:30 UTC (stop loss actually hit)
P&L:   -12 pips (actual movement)
Method: Real Yahoo Finance data
```

**Difference:** More accurate timing, realistic execution, provable results.

- See which playbook bullets perform best
- Identify if stop losses are too tight/loose

### Week 3: Backtest
- Test your strategies over October 2025
- Calculate realistic win rates
- Refine entry zones and stop loss placement

### Week 4: Optimize
- Adjust confidence thresholds
- Refine playbook patterns based on real results
- Consider different risk:reward ratios

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "method: hash_based_fallback" in trade log

**Cause:** Real price data not available
**Solution:** Check date (weekend?), verify internet connection, or accept fallback for that day

### Issue: "No price data available for this date"

**Cause:** Yahoo Finance doesn't have data yet (today) or holiday
**Solution:** This is normal - wait until EOD for finalized data

### Issue: Different results from hash-based

**Cause:** This is expected! Real data ≠ hash-based predictions
**Solution:** This is the point - you now have realistic results
